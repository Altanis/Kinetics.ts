# About
A blazingly fast and easy to use 2D physics engine for JavaScript and TypeScript, both runnable on the web and the server.

## Features
- System/Entity Architecture Support
- Inbuilt Canvas2D Renderer
- Fast Collision Narrowphase Detection
- Fast Collision Broadphase Detection
- Fast Collision Resolution
- Collision Callbacks


## Benchmarks
The benchmarks were performed on a 1920x1080 rectangular system with 1,000 entities, where each entity has a radius randomly selected between 3 and 13. The systems did not have rendering enabled, if a renderer was inbuilt.
